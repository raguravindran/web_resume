## Hosting Options

Here are several ways to host your personal website:

### 1. Netlify (Recommended for Beginners)

Netlify offers free hosting for static websites with a simple deployment process:

1. Create a Netlify account at [netlify.com](https://www.netlify.com/)
2. Click "New site from Git"
3. Connect your GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket account
4. Select your repository
5. Click "Deploy site"

Alternatively, you can drag and drop your website folder directly to the Netlify dashboard.

### 2. GitHub Pages

Free hosting for static websites directly from your GitHub repository:

1. Create a GitHub repository named `yourusername.github.io`
2. Push your website files to this repository
3. Your site will be available at `https://yourusername.github.io`

### 3. Vercel

Similar to Netlify, with a simple deployment process:

1. Sign up at [vercel.com](https://vercel.com/)
2. Import your project from Git
3. Configure build settings if needed
4. Deploy

### 4. Traditional Web Hosting

You can also use traditional web hosting services like:

- Bluehost
- HostGator
- DreamHost
- SiteGround

With these services, you'll need to:

1. Purchase a domain name
2. Subscribe to a hosting plan
3. Upload your files via FTP or their web interface

## Setting Up a Custom Domain

Once you've deployed your site, you might want to use a custom domain:

1. Purchase a domain from providers like Namecheap, GoDaddy, or Google Domains
2. Configure DNS settings to point to your hosting provider
3. Add the custom domain in your hosting provider's settings

Most hosting platforms provide detailed documentation on setting up custom domains.
